     <p> Most of my experience comes from school projects and the work/feedback ive done in those.
      I have had one paid job during the studies with a compant called Compact Carbon Capture.
      Where i first made a simple static website for them and then later on me and another student remade the website to be more dynamic in Wordpress.</p>
