     <p> Most of my experience comes from school projects and the work ive done .
      I have had one ongoing paid project during the studies with a company called Compact Carbon Capture.
      Where i first made a simple static website for them and then later on, me and another student remade the website to be more dynamic in Wordpress.</p>
